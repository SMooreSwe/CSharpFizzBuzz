# C# FizzBuzz

This project is a way for me to get used to coding in C#. I started out using if-else statements, before refactoring to Switch Statements and then Switch Expressions, using pattern-matching and tuples.

As an early attempt to learn a more OOP language, I am happy with how my code turned out and see this as a first step in progressing my knowledge in C# and .Net.

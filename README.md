# C# FizzBuzz

This project is a way for me to get used to coding in C#. 

## Code Methodology 

I started out using if-else statements, before refactoring to Switch Statements and then Switch Expressions, using pattern-matching and tuples.

As an early attempt to learn a more OOP language, I am happy with how my code turned out and see this as a first step in progressing my knowledge in C# and .Net.

## Testing 

This was also a project where I learned to use XUnit for testing and used TDD to build my logic up. The main challenge was working out how I wanted to have my tests check the console output, rather than any return statement, though I solved this with the use of StringWriter and Console.Out.
